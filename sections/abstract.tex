\Gls{GW} observations in the last decade have reinforced the Kerr \gls{BH} paradigm, but these conclusions rely on waveform catalogs dominated by Kerr \glspl{BH}. Expanding the diversity of modeled sources is essential to uncover potential new physics. Here, \textbf{we study the stability of Q-hairy \glspl{BH}}, solutions in the \gls{EMS} model that evade well-known uniqueness theorems, and asses their astrophysical viability.
