We conclude that \textbf{although this model of $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ gravity is able to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe at late times, without requiring dark energy, it shows a tension between high and low redshift measurements}.

We expect that future gravitational wave observatories will be able to provide us with data that can be used to rule this model out, without relying on high redshift measurements.
