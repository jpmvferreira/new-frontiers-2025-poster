Here we study General Relativity minimally coupled to a massive vector field, and how black holes in this theory lose "hair".

  abstract         = {The fundamental role played by black holes in many areas of physics makes it highly important to explore the nature of their stability. The stability of charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes to {\it neutral} (gravitational and electromagnetic) perturbations was established almost four decades ago. However, the stability of these charged black holes under {\it charged} perturbations has remained an open question due to the complexity introduced by the well-known phenomena of superradiant scattering: A charged scalar field impinging on a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole can be {\it amplified} as it scatters off the hole. If the incident field has a non-zero rest mass, then the mass term effectively works as a mirror, preventing the energy extracted from the hole from escaping to infinity. One may suspect that the superradiant amplification of charged fields by the charged black hole may lead to an instability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime (in as much the same way that rotating Kerr black holes are unstable under rotating scalar perturbations). However, in this Letter we show that, for charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the regime ${(Q/M)}^2\leq 8/9$, the two conditions which are required in order to trigger a possible superradiant instability [namely: (1) the existence of a trapping potential well outside the black hole, and (2) superradiant amplification of the trapped modes] cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Our results thus support the stability of charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes under charged scalar perturbations in the regime ${(Q/M)}^2\leq 8/9$.},

Firstly, a trivial Maxwell field is considered, which yields a consistent truncation of the full model. In this case, using a scaling (Derrick-type) argument, it is established that no stationary and axisymmetric self-gravitating scalar solitons exist, unless the scalar potential energy is somewhere negative in spacetime. This generalises previous results for the static and strictly stationary cases. Thus, rotation alone cannot support self-gravitating scalar solitons in this class of models. Secondly, constant sign couplings are considered. Generalising a previous argument by Heusler for electro-vacuum, it is established that no static self-gravitating electromagnetic-scalar solitons exist. Thus, a varying (but constant sign) electric permittivity alone cannot support static Einstein-Maxwell-scalar solitons. Finally, the second result is generalised for strictly stationary, but not necessarily static, spacetimes, using a Lichnerowicz-type argument, generalising previous results in models where the scalar and Maxwell fields are not directly coupled. The scope of validity of each of these results points out the possible paths to circumvent them, in order to obtain self-gravitating solitons in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models.},

Presently we give a brief introduction to this, the science of numerical relativity. We discuss the freedom in formulating general relativity as an initial (boundary) value problem. We touch on the fundamental concepts of well-posedness and gauge freedom and review the standard computational methods employed in the field. We discuss the physical interpretation of numerical spacetime data and end with an overview of a number of 3d codes that are either in use or under active development.},

  abstract         = {Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.},

We show how J and M can be determined in numerical simulations in terms of only those quantities which are intrinsic to the apparent horizon. We also present a numerical method for finding the rotational symmetry vector field (required to calculate J) on the horizon.},

We discuss the key features that enabled long term and stable evolutions of these binaries. We also present a formalism for computing the angular momentum carried away by electromagnetic waves, and the electromagnetic contribution to black-hole horizon properties. We implement our formalism and present the results for the first time in numerical-relativity simulations. In addition, we compare our full non-linear solutions with existing approximate models for the inspiral and ringdown phases. We show that Newtonian models based on the quadrupole approximation have errors of 20 % - 100 % in key gauge-invariant quantities. On the other hand, for the systems considered, we find that estimates of the remnant black hole spin based on the motion of test particles in Kerr-Newman spacetimes agree with our non-linear calculations to within a few percent. Finally, we discuss the prospects for detecting black hole charge by future gravitational-wave detectors using either the inspiral-merger-ringdown signal or the ringdown signal alone.},
